The guideline recommendation evaluator (GREvaluator) is a clinical decision support system based on automated integration of clinical guideline recommendations with real-time clinical data.



Introduction
============
Clinical guideline synthesize the current state of medical knowledge into treatment recommendations and provide thereby a source of decision support for health care professionals. However, the implementation of these guidelines in clinical practice is often hindered by the lack of awareness of individual guideline recommendations existence or applicability for specific patient conditions.

We have therefore designed a system for the automated integration of guideline recommendations with real-time clinical data to provide clinical decision support during individual patient treatments as well as for monitoring of overall guideline implementations.


The is being developed in the context of the `CEOsys: Living evidence synthesis as the basis for decisions in the COVID-19 pandemic <https://covid-evidenz.de/>`_ project.
